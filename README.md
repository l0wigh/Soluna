# Soluna 0.1.0

Soluna is a Lisp dialect interpreted by OCaml.

It does not aim to be perfect, to be accurate, to be easy to use. It aims to be my own Alchemy lab to invoke Gods and Space creatures.

Originaly made as a challenge in a challenge. I wanted to do a Lisp dialect in which I solve at least one AoC (2025) problem.

## What's builtin ?

- lambda and function: functions is basically syntactic sugar for lambdas
- do: let you do multiple operations and yet return nothing ! (trust me it's useful)
- list: let you create a list
- fst: gives you the first item of a list
- rst: gives you the list without the first element
- if: simple if else block
- map: apply a function to a list to get a new function

You need to build the missing tools by yourself

## Other informations

File extension is luna.

There is no comments.

Good luck and have fun.
