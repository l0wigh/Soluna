Soluna is a Lisp dialect interpreted by OCaml.

It does not aim to be perfect, to be accurate, to be easy to use. It aims to be my own Alchemy lab to invoke Gods and Space creatures.

Originaly made as a challenge in a challenge. I wanted to do a Lisp dialect in which I solve at least one AoC (2025) problem.

## What's builtin ?

- lambda and function: functions is basically syntactic sugar for lambdas
- do: let you do multiple operations and yet return nothing ! (trust me it's useful)
- list: let you create a list
- fst: gives you the first item of a list
- rst: gives you the list without the first element
- if: simple if else block
- map: apply a function to a list to get a new function

You need to build the missing tools by yourself

## The OCaml code is... interesting

Yep, might be dirty. I'm not the best in this language, but it works really nice.

I might want to clean the code, at some point. For now it works nice and I want to add some more stuff.

## Other informations

There is some code example. File extension is luna. Good luck and have fun.
