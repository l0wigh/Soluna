; This is a simple code to show the shadowing that occurs in Soluna
; There is x = 10 which is global
; There is x = 20 which is only defined in mutate function
; The global x isn't changed even after redefinition in the function
(defvar x 10)
(function mutate ()
	(do
		(defvar x 20)
		(write "Local x: ")
		(writeln x)
	)
)
(mutate)
(write "Global x: ")
(writeln x)
